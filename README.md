## ABOUT THE PROJECT
    
### üí™ MOTIVATION 
In the dynamic setting of construction sites, where the cacophony of progress resonates through machinery and human endeavor, the accurate identification of fundamental personal protective equipment (PPE) elements such as helmets and vests holds undeniable significance. The driving force behind advancing PPE detection technology lies in the critical need not only to distinguish their presence or absence but also to precisely determine adherence to safety protocols. This distinction between compliance and non-compliance underlines a compelling motivation to enhance safety measures. Every correctly identified helmet and vest, or the lack thereof, reinforces an earnest commitment to safeguarding lives. This endeavor underscores the dedication to ensuring that each individual entering the construction site is adequately equipped to face potential risks.

###  üìåPROBLEM STATEMENT
To develop an advanced computer vision system for accurately identifying personnel wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) in industrial sites. The solution aims to enhance workplace safety, compliance, and operational efficiency by proactively ensuring adherence to safety protocols.

### üåé ENHANCING SAFETY FOR WORKERS AND SOCIETAL ADVANCEMENT 
As nations progress and economies thrive, infrastructure development becomes a cornerstone of growth. Roads, bridges, buildings, and other vital structures emerge from the collaborative efforts of construction workers. Beyond mere presence or absence, the finesse in identifying adherence to safety protocols drives the advancement of PPE detection technology. This nuanced distinction bears a significant motivation: **to strengthen safety measures and fortify lives by precisely identifying construction workers who are not wearing the required safety gear as well as by making sure that every worker is adequately equipped to deal with potential hazards.**


* Its core function is to establish construction sites as secure zones.
* By ensuring every worker wears essential protective gear, the impact extends far beyond site boundaries.
* Construction companies benefit from an enhanced reputation for prioritizing safety, attracting skilled labor and gaining public confidence.

### ‚òÜ Intel oneAPI  <img src="oneapi1.png" alt="png" width="50" height="30" >

oneAPI is a specification that is open and standards-based, supporting multiple architecture types including but not limited to GPU, CPU, and FPGA. The spec has both direct programming and API-based programming paradigms.The direct programming model provides a flexible, modern C++ language that allows developers to write parallel algorithms and integrate them into existing C++ codebases. Compilers can then take this expressed parallelism and target CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other hardware.
<br> **oneDNN toolkit** </br>
The Intel¬Æ oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) provides highly optimized implementations of deep learning building blocks. With this open source, cross-platform library, deep learning application and framework developers can use the same API for CPUs, GPUs, or both‚Äîit abstracts out instruction sets and other complexities of performance optimization.
<br> **AI Analytics toolkit** </br>
This comprehensive toolkit enables us to accelerate end-to-end data science and machine learning pipelines using Python* tools and frameworks and leverages the state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, which are optimized for the Intel architecture by the oneAPI platform. The toolkit also provides support for several pre-trained models, including DenseNet, ResNet, YOLOv3, and more, which have been instrumental in our project.
### STEPS IN THE PROJECT 

1) Importing the necessary libraries like Tensorflow, Scikit-learn extension for intel, Pillow, etc.
2) Importing the dataset
3) Data Preperation
  * Creating a Generator for Training Set
  * Creating a Generator for Testing Set
4) Model Creation with oneDNN toolkit
5) Model Compilation
6) Training the Model and Testing Predictions
7) Saving model as 'oneDNN.h5'
8) Deploying the Model as a Web Application using Streamlit
